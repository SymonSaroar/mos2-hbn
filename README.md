# mos2 on hbn
Simulation of MoS2 growth on HBN
Originally aimed towards finding most stable interlayer distance and stacking angle

* Find minimum interlayer distance
* Plot theta - Energy graph by pressing on the play button beside the theta silder

* all incremental precision is controlled by precision controller

# Currently Default n = 15, h = 100 (Very High CPU usage)
